- Extend a quantumn bariable by one extra bit 101 becomes 0101
- Create qutatum variable of size guven by classical   int a = 5    qN: b = 10
- CX gate on variables allow different size inputs
- Decide if to allow controlled-swap
- there is apperently a |0> reset gate. then early measurement is compulsory.
- also a if on classsical gate.
- allow a[0] = H(a[0]);
